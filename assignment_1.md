After being in Integrated Digital Media for only one year, I am starting to see a trend of the types of messages that they are trying to convey. In the required class of history of media of culture and communication with Isra Ali, she teaches about the “aura” of artwork, the start and evolution of photography, and the idea of the culture industry. Reproduction does change an image, artwork, media, etc. However, it is necessary because of our difference in classes or income. For some people, seeing the Mona Lisa might be impossible because they cannot afford to travel to France and buy a ticket to the Louvre, which means the only way they would or could be able to see it is through mass production of reproductions. An example of this reproduction is the Mona Lisa being on postcards, aprons, magnets, scarfs, and more all over Europe. This changes the meaning of the Mona Lisa while, at the same time, giving the painting more power and influence. The reproduction of an artwork into different forms changes the meaning when the popularity or audience changes. For example, the beautiful hills of Sonoma County would have been only beautiful for the residents or visitors in that area. However, since Windows has made the default wallpaper the hills of Sonoma County, there is a different and greater appreciation of that location. The computation of artwork gives the information in order for it to be preserved or reproduced. I think this creates a bigger sphere of fans. For the people that argue that artwork is ruined with copies because viewers think “well I have seen the photo, I do not need to see it in real life,” I would argue that those viewers never truly appreciated it nor cared about it. For them, it was just something that was well known but not something that was important for them.
