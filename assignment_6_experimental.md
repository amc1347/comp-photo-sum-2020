For this week’s new photography technique, I tried the 3D photo. I was inspired by a meme that I saw on Facebook once about a doge. Here is the link: https://www.facebook.com/9gag/posts/10159189879251840. In this link, it is a 9GAG post using a 3D image and the subject is a shiba inu holding two toy dogs and we have to move the phone around to make them kiss. When I first saw that image, I honestly was so shocked at the genuinity of the subject and how such a simple thing could be so heartwarming. So I tried to recreate my own version with my dog. What I did not realize was that it is much harder than it looked. While 3D images may seem easy when all you do is apply the button on the image, when you want it to do a specific task, it is much harder. 

I downloaded the app PopPic and learned that it was preferred to use portrait mode in order to get the best results. So I took a bunch of different types of photos and picked the ones with the best result, which ended up being three different photos. I took screen recordings of the interaction and movement since it is not really possible to post a 3D photo on google drive so I had to use facebook’s.
