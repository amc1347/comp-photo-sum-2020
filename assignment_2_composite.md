I chose 25 photos from the past concerts that I have been to. I have always been obsessed with lighting at concerts so I always try and get a good photo of the lighting and effects. (Yeah, I am that one person who is always recording at a concert, #noshame) I chose 25 of the best ones and lined them up so that the crowd would match up on the bottom and that the middle would all be centered.
