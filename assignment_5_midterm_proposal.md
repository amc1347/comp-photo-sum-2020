Continuing on with the images from last week. I pulled from the same collection and will play around with the same types of manipulation. With these 6 images, I hope to change the mood of the image through shapes and colors. With the color images, they are more of a warm hue and in all different settings. I plan on changing the mood by altering the color scheme and coolness/warmness of the photos. For the more structured line images, I plan on figuring out how to put in some lateral and horizontal lines.
