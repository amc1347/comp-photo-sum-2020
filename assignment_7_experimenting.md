In these photos, I decided to try and mimic a seismograph but instead of measuring earthquakes, it would measure the bass of the music and instead of a needle, it was an LED light. It definitely took a while to set it up, but I was super surprised by the result. I initially wanted the LED touching the bottom of the circle to be the one that would track the movements. However, it ended up being the LEDs that were along the string that would move more to the beat.
