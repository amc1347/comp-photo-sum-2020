I chose 25 photos from the past concerts that I have been to. I have always been obsessed with lighting at concerts so I always try and get a good photo of the lighting and effects. (Yeah, I am that one person who is always recording at a concert, #noshame) I chose 25 of the best ones and lined them up so that the crowd would match up on the bottom and that the middle would all be centered. I put the opacity at 40% for layers 1-10 and then from 11-20 it was at 30% and the last five were all at 17%. 

I was really amazed at how you could see the audienceâ€™s hands up. I think it gave me a huge wave of memories of singing along to all the songs and people having their flashlights up.
