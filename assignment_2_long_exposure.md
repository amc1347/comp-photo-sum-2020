For the 10 long exposure shots, I chose to go back to the location where I had done my Two Dozen assignment because I wanted another chance at capturing the beauty. However, this time, I decided to have it be sort of a journey. It starts off at that same location but then it slowly moves along to another location and the pictures are part of that journey. WIth module 2, I did want to sort of capture a movement with these photos but not in static movement but more active movement. I really enjoyed the firefly long exposure shots because of the use of natural lights in the pictures. I would love to recreate something like that once I have more experience with the DSLR but for now, I chose something that I could keep retaking if the pictures turned out bad. I also loved the LED long exposure shots talked about in the Felton video. I think the Roomba LED project was super creative.

The relationship between my photographic method and the subject matter was trying to capture the movement while in movement. It took me a while to figure out the ISO (I eventually googled it) but once I got the right ISO, I realized that it was about lights. Due to COVID-19, there were barely any cars on the streets so it was hard to capture more brake lights rather than stoplights. I do like that in some of the photos, the reflection of the street sign became part of that moment because of the lightâ€™s reflection. With my editing (I finally opened Lightroom for the first time since downloading it 2 years ago), I tried to use the color of the sky as part of the photos. Instead of leaving them pitch black, I wanted to be able to capture the freshly royal blue sky fresh after the sunset with the contrast of the streetlights.
