I decided on three pictures that I took while studying abroad. I collected pictures of beautiful ceilings as I traveled. I really appreciated the symmetry in the photos and in the architecture. I donâ€™t know the exposure of these pictures because I took them with my phone. However, with the editing, I did try and leave the beauty of the architecture because there is just so much geometry involved. I tried to do one with color and black and white. For my midterm, I will definitely try and see if I can figure out how to do very axis-ly based editing. 

I had quite some trouble with the coding at first but I did find many examples and troubleshooting on codepen and stack overflow. This was definitely a learning experience.
